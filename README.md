# MyHealthApp

The MyHealth App has been developed for an NGO incollaboration with Frugal Innovation Lab and Sparrow Mobile. 
This is a desktop application, where the administrator can create the profiles for other admins, patients and doctors and would have access to edit or delete any profile.
The administrator has the following additional features.
1. Book a group appointment for the patients and assign a particular doctor.
2. Feeds the appointment information in the patient's mobile and provide the reminders (for example : in an interval of 7 day, 3 day, 1 day, 5 hrs etc.) for the appointment in the form of pop ups.
3. Feeds the medicines and corresponding time to take them in the patient's mobile and provide timely reminders in the form of pop-ups.
4. In case the patient doesn't respond to the reminders, the coordinator tracks the patient's treatment and would follow up with the patient.
5. Feeds the pharmacy information in the patient's mobile in case of refilling the medicines.

This app is developed using AngularJS for the UI.
